## How to Contact Us

Do you have a question about our holdings or how to get started on your research?
Contact the RAC Reference team at [archive@rockarch.org](mailto:archive@rockarch.org).

## How to Research at the RAC

Anyone can conduct research at the RAC. If we have archival materials that can be
useful to your research topic, you are welcome here.

Because of limited seating capacity, researchers need an appointment in order to
conduct in-person research in the RAC’s two Reading Rooms. Contact the RAC Reference
team at [archive@rockarch.org](mailto:archive@rockarch.org) to make your
appointment.

You will also need to create a researcher account in [RACcess](https://raccess.rockarch.org),
our online request and duplication management system.

Get started on your research by searching our online finding aid catalog [DIMES](https://dimes.rockarch.org).

## When We’re Open

The RAC’s two Reading Rooms are open Monday through Friday from 9:00
am to 5:00 pm, except for [designated holidays](holiday-schedule/).

Inclement weather can sometimes require the RAC to close for the safety of
our staff and researchers. During the winter, if ice or snow is predicted for
suburban New York, it is advisable to telephone the RAC at 914-631-4505. A
recording noting a closure or delayed opening is generally posted by 7:30
a.m. If you have a scheduled research appointment, we will also do our best
to email with as much advanced notice of the closure as possible.

## Amenities

Since the RAC is not located near restaurants or stores, we encourage
researchers to bring their own lunches. We have a researcher lounge with a
refrigerator and microwave. We also provide assorted cold beverages as
well as tea and coffee. WiFi is available throughout the RAC.

If you come on a different train or miss the RAC shuttle van, there is a taxi
stand at the Tarrytown station.

## What You Can Expect When You Get Here

When you arrive on the first day of your scheduled research visit, an
archivist will greet you and give you a brief orientation to make your visit
productive and positive.

We’re an archive of important historical materials, so we do have a few
simple rules that we ask all researchers to follow when they’re in the RAC’s
two Reading Rooms:

- Place your outerwear, bags, and other nonessential items in the
lockers provided.
- Use only pencils and laptops for notes. No pens.
- Food, beverages, and chewing gum are not permitted.
- Review one folder at a time and mark its place with the OUT card
provided
- Items in folders should not be rearranged or removed.
- Avoid placing other items on top of documents. Ask the desk monitor
for book weights.
- If metal fasteners need to be removed, ask the desk monitor for
assistance.

Our Reading Rooms can be cool at times, so be sure and bring a sweater.
Generally speaking, you may use a digital camera or your phone or tablet
to photograph collection materials for research and educational purposes.
However, the desk monitors may place some restrictions on your
photography if the archival materials being handled are fragile or in poor
condition.

The RAC has several microfilm reader-scanners available in our Reading
Rooms which enable researchers to print or to save images from microfilm
onto flash drives. We encourage you to bring your own flash drive if you
anticipate using microfilm during your visit.

## Duplication Services and Fee Schedule

The RAC offers duplication services for on-site and off-site researchers. If
you have any questions about ordering copies of our holdings, please
