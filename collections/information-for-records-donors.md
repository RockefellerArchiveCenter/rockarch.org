## What We Collect

The Rockefeller Archive Center is a repository of historical materials and a research center
dedicated to the study of philanthropy. The RAC holds the archives of major foundations, cultural
organizations, research institutions, and many individuals associated with these organizations.
The RAC collects records in almost any format, including paper records, photographic media,
sound and moving image recordings, and digitized and born digital records.

## If You Have Never Donated to the RAC Before

If you or your organization are considering making a first-time donation of records and other
archival materials to the RAC, please email us at [donorservices@rockarch.org](mailto:donorservices@rockarch.org). Tell us who you are and what you have, and a member of the RACâ€™s team will get back to you as soon as possible.

## If You Are a Current Donor

If you or your organization have previously donated records or other archival materials to the RAC,
please contact us at DonorServices@rockarch.org for scheduling courier runs, assistance with an
organizational reference request, and general questions regarding the records transfer process.

If you are with an organization whose records are on deposit with the RAC and you need to request
the return of any of your files, please request material through [RACcess](https://raccess.rockarch.org), our online request
management system, and send a follow-up email to [donorservices@rockarch.org](mailto:donorservices@rockarch.org).

You can view the finding aids to your processed and publicly available archival collections by
using our online finding aid catalog [DIMES](https://dimes.rockarch.org).
