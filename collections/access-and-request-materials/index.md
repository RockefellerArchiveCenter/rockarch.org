Do you have a question about our holdings or how to get started on your research?
Contact the RAC Access team at [archive@rockarch.org](mailto:archive@rockarch.org).

## How to Research at the RAC

Anyone can conduct research at the RAC. If we have archival materials that can be useful to your research topic, you are welcome here.

Because of limited seating capacity, researchers need an appointment in order to
conduct in-person research in the RAC’s Reading Room. Contact the RAC Access
team at [archive@rockarch.org](mailto:archive@rockarch.org) to make your
appointment.

You will also need to create a researcher account in [RACcess](https://raccess.rockarch.org),
our online request and duplication management system.

Get started on your research by searching our online finding aid catalog [DIMES](https://dimes.rockarch.org).

As with our archival materials, [Library materials](https://library.rockarch.org) are non-circulating and are only available in the RAC’s reading rooms.

For more details about the accessibility of the physical space, see our [Accessibility Statement](/about-us/accessibility).

## When We’re Open

The RAC is currently only operating one Reading Room, with limited seating capacity,
which is open Monday through Friday from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm, except for
[designated holidays](holiday-schedule/).

Inclement weather can sometimes require the RAC to close for the safety of
our staff and researchers. During the winter, if ice or snow is predicted for
suburban New York, it is advisable to telephone the RAC at (914) 366-6300. A
recording noting a closure or delayed opening is generally posted by 7:30
a.m. If you have a scheduled research appointment, we will also do our best
to email you with as much advanced notice of the closure as possible.

## Amenities

Since the RAC is not located near restaurants or stores, we encourage researchers
to bring their own lunches. We have a researcher lounge with a refrigerator,
toaster oven, and microwave. We also provide assorted cold beverages, tea and
coffee, and individually packaged snacks.

Several food delivery apps also deliver to the RAC, including UberEats, GrubHub,
and DoorDash. Researchers are welcome to order lunch from those services for
delivery to the RAC's address: 15 Dayton Avenue, Sleepy Hollow New York 10591.

WiFi is available throughout the RAC.

## Before Your Visit

Within the week prior to your visit, we’ll need to schedule a virtual orientation.
An archivist will be in touch about scheduling a virtual orientation (one-on-one)
which should not take more than 30 minutes. We’ll review the reading room policies
and procedures and get you ready to work in the reading room, and if you would
like, we can chat further about your project and the archival collections.

## What You Can Expect When You Get Here

For more details about the accessibility of the physical space, see our
[Accessibility Statement](/about-us/accessibility).

When you arrive on the first day of your scheduled research visit, you will be
greeted and brought up to the reading room.

We’re an archive of important historical materials, so we do have a few
simple rules that we ask all researchers to follow when they’re in the RAC’s
Reading Room:

- Place your outerwear, bags, and other nonessential items in the
lockers provided.
- Use only pencils and laptops for notes. No pens.
- Food, beverages, and chewing gum are not permitted.
- Review one folder at a time and mark its place in the box with the OUT card
provided
- Items in folders should not be rearranged or removed.
- Avoid placing other items on top of documents. Ask the desk monitor
for book weights.
- If metal fasteners need to be removed, ask the desk monitor for
assistance.

Our Reading Room can be cool at times, so be sure and bring a sweater.
Generally speaking, you may use a digital camera or your phone or tablet
to photograph collection materials for research and educational purposes.
However, the desk monitors may place some restrictions on your
photography if the archival materials being handled are fragile or in poor
condition.

The RAC has several microfilm reader-scanners available in our Reading
Room which enable researchers to print or to save images from microfilm
onto flash drives. We encourage you to bring your own flash drive if you
anticipate using microfilm during your visit.

## Duplication Services and Fee Schedule

The RAC offers duplication services for on-site and off-site researchers. If
you have any questions about ordering copies of our holdings, please
contact the RAC Access team at [archive@rockarch.org](mailto:archive@rockarch.org).

The RAC may decline to copy certain documents that in its judgment may
suffer damage as a result of duplication.

PLEASE NOTE: Because of increased demand for duplication services caused by the 
pandemic and our re-opening to onsite researchers, we are currently experiencing 
a greater than normal delay in fulfilling requests. We thank you for your patience 
as we work to reduce the backlog and complete orders in as timely a manner as possible.

### PDFs or TIFF/JPEG images
Duplication requests are limited to 500 pages/images per order.

- Unit cost: $0.50 per page/image
- Service charge: $10.00 per order.
- Orders are sent via electronic delivery without additional charge.

### Audiovisual Materials

For on-site researchers, accessible (already digitized) audiovisual files are available for download at the RAC through our Virtual Vault.

For off-site researchers, the following fee schedule applies to audiovisual material for which we already have digital access files. If access files currently do not exist, the costs associated with "Outsourced Digitization" applies in addition to the following charges:

- Unit cost: $10.00 per title (Format: Audio MP3 or moving image MP4)
- Service charge: $25.00 per order
- Audiovisual material will be delivered electronically, unless otherwise arranged. The RAC does not create DVD or CD copies.
- Higher-resolution audiovisual files are to be arranged with the RAC. Please contact us at [archive@rockarch.org](mailto:archive@rockarch.org) for further information on time and cost estimates.

### Outsourced Duplication

Duplication of any material that is oversized, bound, three-dimensional, fragile, or damaged, as well as duplication of audiovisual materials, will be outsourced to an external vendor. Please contact us at
[archive@rockarch.org](mailto:archive@rockarch.org) for further details, including time and cost estimates.

## Copyright

The RAC strives to provide accurate general copyright information in our ﬁnding aids, but copyright ownership and restrictions can vary by collection and by author or creator of the material. It is the responsibility of the researcher/user of the material to make a determination of copyright and to obtain any necessary permissions prior to usage. Please contact the RAC Access team at [archive@rockarch.org](mailto:archive@rockarch.org) if you have specific copyright questions.

## Citations

If you are citing to archival materials in the RAC, at a minimum we recommend that your citation include the following: Title of document, date of document, author of document, folder title, title of collection, and our institutional name: Rockefeller Archive Center. Finding aid (FA) number and box numbers can be useful, but since these numbers can change over time, they are not recommended for citation purposes.
