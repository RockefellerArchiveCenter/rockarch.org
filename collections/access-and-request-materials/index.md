## Ask a Question

The Access team is available to answer questions about the RAC's archival holdings. Our goal is to support you in connecting with the collections that will be most helpful to your research project, but we are not able to undertake archival research on your behalf.

Please send your inquiry to [archive@rockarch.org](mailto:archive@rockarch.org).

Provide as much detailed information as possible about your research interest. An Access team member will respond to your request within 10 working days.

## Plan a Research Visit

Anyone can conduct research at the RAC. If we have archival materials that can be useful to your research topic, you are welcome here.

Because of limited seating capacity, researchers need an appointment in order to
conduct in-person research in the RAC’s Reading Room. Contact the RAC Access
team at [archive@rockarch.org](mailto:archive@rockarch.org) to make your
appointment.

You will also need to create a researcher account in [RACcess](https://raccess.rockarch.org),
our online request and duplication management system.

Get started on your research by searching our online finding aid catalog [DIMES](https://dimes.rockarch.org).

As with our archival materials, [Library materials](https://library.rockarch.org) are non-circulating and are only available in the RAC’s reading rooms.

For more details about the accessibility of the physical space, see our [Accessibility Statement](/about-us/accessibility).

## When We’re Open

The RAC Reading Rooms are open Monday through Friday from 9:30 am to 5:00 pm, except for
[designated holidays](holiday-schedule/).

Inclement weather can sometimes require the RAC to close for the safety of
our staff and researchers. During the winter, if ice or snow is predicted for
suburban New York, it is advisable to telephone the RAC at (914) 366-6300. A
recording noting a closure or delayed opening is generally posted by 7:30
a.m. If you have a scheduled research appointment, we will also do our best
to email you with as much advanced notice of the closure as possible.

## Amenities

Since the RAC is not located near restaurants or stores, we encourage researchers
to bring their own lunches. We have a researcher lounge with a refrigerator,
toaster oven, and microwave. We also provide assorted cold beverages, tea and
coffee, and individually packaged snacks.

Several food delivery apps also deliver to the RAC, including UberEats, GrubHub,
and DoorDash. Researchers are welcome to order lunch from those services for
delivery to the RAC's address: 15 Dayton Avenue, Sleepy Hollow New York 10591.

WiFi is available throughout the RAC.

## Before Your Visit

If you’ve never been to the RAC before (or if it’s been a while and you’d like a 
refresher), we’ll schedule a virtual orientation which should not take more than 
30 minutes. We’ll review the reading room policies and procedures, familiarize 
you with our facility, and chat further about your project and the archival 
collections.

## What You Can Expect When You Get Here

For more details about the accessibility of the physical space, see our
[Accessibility Statement](/about-us/accessibility).

When you arrive on the first day of your scheduled research visit, please 
proceed up the stairs to the second floor. The reading rooms are at the 
end of the hallway.

We’re an archive of important historical materials, so we do have a few
simple rules that we ask all researchers to follow when they’re in the RAC’s
Reading Room:

- Place your outerwear, bags, and other nonessential items in the
lockers provided.
- Use only pencils and laptops for notes. No pens.
- Food, beverages, and chewing gum are not permitted.
- Review one folder at a time and mark its place in the box with the OUT card
provided
- Items in folders should not be rearranged or removed.
- Avoid placing other items on top of documents. Ask the desk monitor
for book weights.
- If metal fasteners need to be removed, ask the desk monitor for
assistance.

The top shelf of the cart will be kept clear, and you should place the box 
you are actively using on the top shelf so that there is plenty of room on 
your table for a folder and your laptop.

Our Reading Room can be cool at times, so be sure and bring a sweater.
Generally speaking, you may use a digital camera or your phone or tablet
to photograph collection materials for research and educational purposes.
However, the desk monitors may place some restrictions on your
photography if the archival materials being handled are fragile or in poor
condition.

The RAC has several microfilm reader-scanners available in our Reading
Room which enable researchers to print or to save images from microfilm
onto flash drives. We encourage you to bring your own flash drive if you
anticipate using microfilm during your visit.

## Requesting Materials at the RAC

All onsite researchers at the RAC must have a confirmed appointment and have 
created a researcher account in [RACcess](https://raccess.rockarch.org/), our 
online request and duplication management system, prior to your arrival.

Before your visit, we recommend that you select an initial group of materials 
that we can have ready for you on your arrival. This can be done through the 
RAC’s online finding aid catalog [DIMES](https://dimes.rockarch.org/) or the 
online [Library materials catalog](https://library.rockarch.org/). Once you 
find an item you want to request, add it to your list and then submit a request 
to view the materials in our reading room by 5:00 pm Eastern time the business 
day prior to your appointment day. Be sure and indicate the correct date of 
your first appointment day in your request.

- We deliver up to 10 items at a time. If archival containers are too large 
  to fit all 10 items on a cart, we’ll keep some items back and deliver them 
  to you at the next delivery time.
- We will only keep up to 10 items on one cart per person in the reading room 
  at a time due to space limitations.
- The top shelf of the cart will be kept clear, and you should place the box 
  you are actively using on the top shelf so that there is plenty of room on 
  your table for a folder and your laptop.
- Some archival materials are stored in offsite locations and may take up to 
  48 hours (2 full business days) to retrieve.
- Oversized materials such as posters, maps, and architectural drawings cannot 
  be brought safely to the reading rooms. Such materials will be pulled for 
  researcher review in another space in the RAC building and will be coordinated 
  with a RAC staff member.
- Digitized audiovisual materials are accessible in our Reading Rooms through 
  the RAC’s Virtual Vault. Audiovisual materials that are not yet digitized 
  will need to be reviewed by the Audiovisual Archivist to determine if there 
  are any preservation issues in providing access. It may take up to 8 hours 
  (2 full business days) to complete this review.

We have scheduled materials delivery times based on the following schedule. 
- The RAC Reading Rooms are open to researchers from 9:30 am to 5:00 pm, Monday through Friday.
- Researchers are responsible for requesting that the Reading Room desk monitor stage the next 10 items for retrieval.
- If you believe you will need fresh materials at the next delivery time, we recommend that you proactively work with the desk monitor to stage your next selections after each new delivery so that you do not have to wait for a later delivery time. We will not do special pulls outside of scheduled delivery times.
- We do not deliver materials between 11:30 am and 1:30 pm so that researchers and RAC staff alike can enjoy their lunch hours and so that we can prepare for the 1:30 pm delivery.

## Duplication Services

The RAC offers digitization services to both our onsite and virtual or offsite users.

To get started, you will need to create a user account in [RACcess](https://raccess.rockarch.org/),
the RAC’s online request and duplication management system. Once you’ve created your account, 
duplication requests can be made directly through your account or from our 
[DIMES online catalog’s](https://dimes.rockarch.org/) My List page, which connects to your account.

Digitization requests are generally processed on a first-come, first-served basis. The RAC 
endeavors to fulfill all digitization requests within 90 days. However, a request may take
longer depending on the volume of materials being requested and whether additional handling 
is necessary due to the original item’s condition or format. We do not do rush orders.

Please note that the RAC may decline to copy certain materials that in its judgment may 
suffer damage due to the handling necessary for digitization. Any materials with serious 
preservation concerns will be evaluated and may require us to use an outside digitization 
vendor. 

### Fees and Limitations

RAC duplication request fees and limitations are based on the item you have identified through 
our DIMES online catalog, usually a file (regardless of the number of pages or folders 
associated with the file), an oversized flat file item (such as a map or blueprint), or 
an audiovisual item. Each item requested constitutes a “transaction” for digitization, 
regardless of page count.

**The RAC charges a flat fee of $25.00 per transaction.** We do not charge for materials that 
have already been digitized.

**Users will be billed for each transaction as it is completed.** If you have submitted multiple 
digitization transactions, we will bill and deliver each transaction as it completed to ensure 
that we can process all requests as efficiently as possible.

**Users are limited to requesting 20 transactions per calendar year.** We encourage you to 
consult with an archivist at [archive@rockarch.org](mailto:archive@rockarch.org) to assist 
you in prioritizing your transaction requests prior to ordering.

#### Audiovisual materials
- Already digitized audiovisual files are available for download by onsite users at the RAC 
  through our Virtual Vault. These files will be delivered electronically to offsite users, 
  unless otherwise arranged. The RAC does not create DVD or CD copies.
- If access files currently do not exist, audiovisual items must be sent to an outside 
  digitization vendor, and the user will be charged the vendor cost in addition to the $25.00 
  transaction fee. This process could take up to six months to complete. Please contact us at 
  [archive@rockarch.org](mailto:archive@rockarch.org) for further details, including time and 
  cost estimates.
- Higher-resolution audiovisual files are to be arranged with the RAC. Please contact us at 
  [archive@rockarch.org](mailto:archive@rockarch.org) for further information on time and cost 
  estimates.

#### Oversized flat file items. 
- The RAC can digitize individual oversized flat file items (maps, blueprints, posters, etc.) 
  up to 34 inches by 24 inches (34” x 24”) in size. 
- All larger sizes must be sent to an outside digitization vendor, and the user will be 
  charged the vendor cost in addition to the $25.00 transaction fee. This process could take 
  up to six months to complete. Please contact us at [archive@rockarch.org](mailto:archive@rockarch.org) 
  for further details, including time and cost estimates.

#### Publication quality individual pages or photographic images. 
- Users requesting a high-resolution, publication quality scan of an individual page or 
  photographic image may make such requests though their RACcess account and then must follow 
  up with an email to [archive@rockarch.org](mailto:archive@rockarch.org) that includes details 
  of the specific image being requested and the resolution requirements. 
- Because such requests require special handling, you will be charged $25.00 per image with a 
  limit of 20 items. 
- Please consult with an archivist at [archive@rockarch.org](mailto:archive@rockarch.org) with any questions.

## Copyright

The RAC strives to provide accurate general copyright information in our ﬁnding aids, but copyright ownership and restrictions can vary by collection and by author or creator of the material. It is the responsibility of the researcher/user of the material to make a determination of copyright and to obtain any necessary permissions prior to usage. Please contact the RAC Access team at [archive@rockarch.org](mailto:archive@rockarch.org) if you have specific copyright questions.

## Citations

When citing archival materials at the RAC, you should include the following information which represents the basic intellectual hierarchy of the archival record and should be sufficient to locate most documents: 
  - Title or description of document 
  - Date of document 
  - Author of document if known  
  - Title of file 
  - Collection title  
  - Our institutional name: Rockefeller Archive Center  

For larger and more complex collections, consider including the following additional information that reflects organizational file groupings or hierarchy within the records when you see it in the archival description:  
  - Series (name and/or number) 
  - Record Group (name and/or number) 
  - Subgroup (name and/or number) 

The "Cite" button in the RAC's DIMES online finding aid catalog can be used to export relevant citation information for a file unit. 

Since box numbers and folder numbers are not unique permanent identifiers, they are not reliable for citation purposes and should not be used as part of a citation. 

It is the responsibility of researchers to collect the information necessary to create a proper citation while research is being conducted. The RAC’s staff cannot do this work for you.
