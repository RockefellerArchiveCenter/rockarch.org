## About the RAC Stipend Program

The Rockefeller Archive Center offers a competitive research stipend program that provides individuals (not institutions) up to $5,000 for reimbursement of travel and accommodation expenses.  The stipend can only be used to facilitate research at the RAC, not for research at other archival repositories or for tuition support.

Applications are reviewed by an independent committee that considers an applicant’s topic and the availability of relevant archival materials at the RAC. Anyone can apply for a research stipend, regardless of country of origin. Please be aware that certain U.S Government requirements may apply to non-U.S. citizens.

## How to Apply for an RAC Research Stipend

Important dates and deadlines:

- Applicants should contact RAC staff at [archive@rockarch.org](mailto:archive@rockarch.org) with a description of the research project by **October 15**.
-	Application forms should be submitted by midnight Eastern Standard Time on **November 1**.
-	Two letters of recommendation are due by **November 22**.
-	Awards are announced by **February 28**.
-	Please note that researchers who have previously received an RAC research stipend must wait three years in order to be eligible to receive another stipend. For example, an application submitted in November 2010 that resulted in an award in February 2011 means that the recipient was eligible to apply again in November 2013 to receive an award in February 2014.

In order to be eligible for a stipend, potential applicants must contact the RAC by October 15 with a description of the proposed project that includes a brief narrative, the names of any individuals, institutions, and subjects, and relevant date ranges central to the research topic. RAC staff then will respond identifying potentially useful archival materials and an estimate of the time necessary to conduct the proposed research. This information will assist an applicant in completing the application form.

## After Receiving an RAC Research Stipend

Stipend recipients have one year to complete the proposed research, from April 1 of the award year through March 31 of the following year.

At the conclusion of the award year, stipend recipients must submit a short report on their research at the RAC. By accepting the stipend, recipients give permission for the RAC to make edited versions or excerpts of these research reports available online through its website or other resource.

Recipients should also provide the RAC with a copy of any publication resulting from the research supported by the stipend.

In order to be reimbursed for travel and accommodation expenses, stipend recipients must provide receipts following completion of the research visit.
