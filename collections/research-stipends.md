## About the RAC Stipend Program

The Rockefeller Archive Center's competitive research stipend program provides awards of up to
$5000 for reimbursement of receipted expenses for travel and accommodation in conjunction
with research conducted at the RAC.

An independent committee reviews each application based on the applicant's research topic and
the availability of relevant material in the RAC's collections. Awards are made to individuals.
Institutions are not eligible to apply. The stipend does not support research at other institutions,
and it does not provide general tuition support. Application to the research stipend program is
open to U.S. citizens and citizens of foreign countries. Certain U.S. Government requirements will
apply to non-U.S. citizens.

## Guidelines for Application

The deadline for applications is November 1st each year (applications must be received before
midnight Eastern Standard Time on November 1), and awards will be announced at the end of the
following February. Stipend recipients must commence their research at the Center after April 1 of
their award year, and they must complete their research by March 31 of the following year. Stipend
recipients are requested to submit a short report on their research at the Center. Edited versions of,
or excerpts from these reports, may be used in the Center's publications and on its website.
Recipients also are asked to provide the Center with a copy of any publication resulting from
research conducted as a result of the stipend. Reimbursement of expenses will be following the
receipt of original travel and accommodation receipts following the completion of the stipend
recipient's research visit.

We require potential applicants to contact the Archive Center's staff by email no later than October
15th with a description of the research project for which they seek support. Such descriptions
should describe the project briefly and include the names of any individuals and institutions that
are central to the story, and the years covered by the study. This will help our staff respond with a
description of any relevant material in the collections located here, which in turn helps applicants
complete the application form and estimate the duration of their proposed research trip.

Please note that three (3) cycles must elapse before a former stipend recipient is eligible to receive
another stipend. (For example, if a stipend was awarded in 2011, 2015 would be the next program
for which the stipend recipient would be eligible to apply, and the application submission
deadline for the 2015 program would be November 1, 2014.)

### Special Stipend to Support Research in the Paul Ehrlich Collection

Through a generous gift the Rockefeller Archive Center has available funds to support short-term
research in the Paul Ehrlich Collection at the Archive Center. The Ehrlich Collection is the largest
and most important body of original and facsimile materials documenting the life and scientific-medical
research program of Nobel Laureate Paul Ehrlich (1854-1915). Certain documents are
available in English translations.

Prospective applicants are required to contact the Archive Center with an initial description of
their research. This will help applicants to determine the extent of related materials. Contact us at

Application to the Ehrlich stipend program may be made at any time and, if judged worthy, awards
will be made within a month of the receipt of the applicant's two letters of recommendation.
Letters of recommendation should be one page in length, on official letterhead, and include a
confidential assessment of the applicant's qualifications and goals, comments on the importance
of the proposed research, and any other pertinent information. References should email their
letters to [RACgrants@rockarch.org](mailto:racgrants@rockarch.org). Stipend recipients must commence their research at the
Center within one year of being notified of the award. Application to this program is open to U.S.
citizens and citizens of foreign countries. Stipend recipients are requested to submit a short report
on their research at the Center. Edited versions of or excerpts from these reports may be used in
the Center's publications. Recipients also are asked to provide the Center with a copy of any
publication resulting from research conducted as a result of the stipend. Reimbursement of up to
$4,000 will be made upon receipt of original expense receipts after the completion of the stipend
recipient's research visit.

### Stipend Through the Constortium for History of Science, Technology, and
Medicine

The Rockefeller Archive Center is part of the [Consortium for History of Science, Technology, and Medicine](https://www.chstm.org/). Founded in 2007 with grants from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the National
Science Foundation, the Consortium promotes public and scholarly understanding of the
multitude of ways in which science, technology, and medicine shape our lives. It hosts both
scholarly and public events on the history of science, medicine and technology. Since its inception,
the Consortium has established a [fellowship program](https://www.chstm.org/fellowships/chstm-fellowships)
offering support for research across the scholarly collections of the consortium,
created an online search capability which has opened up access to the special
collections of the consortium, and has set up and now maintains what has become
the comprehensive calendar for all regional events in the history of these fields.
As many of the collections of the Rockefeller Archive Center document large sweeps
of the twentieth- and twenty-first century development of science, medicine,
technology, and the social sciences, we encourage scholars to learn more about
the Consortium and its fellowship programs.
