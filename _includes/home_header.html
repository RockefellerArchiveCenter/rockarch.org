          <h2 style="color: white;">Our Statement in Solidarity with the Black Community</h2>
        <p style="color: white;font-size: 1.5em;">We at the Rockefeller Archive Center join our colleagues around the nation
        and the world in our devastation over the murders of black Americans at the
        hands of the state and of their fellow citizens. As the staff of an archive,
        we are painfully aware of our country’s violent history of racism and hate,
        but that this violence continues so relentlessly is unconscionable. We know
        that we can and must do better.</p>

        <p style="color: white;font-size: 1.5em;">We recognize that the toxic presence of white supremacy lives in many of the
        records we hold. At the same time, our archives also contain the records of
        individuals and organizations that have worked to confront the systemic racism
        in our culture.  We must do more than simply preserve these records and make
        them available. We need to find new ways to gather, reveal, and tell these
        stories--of success and failure—so that others can learn from and improve on
        the efforts of the past.</p>

        <p style="color: white;font-size: 1.5em;">And as we renew our commitment to strengthening diversity in our own
        institution, we also commit to engaging with other cultural institutions as we
        seek to take a more active role in the movement toward social justice.</p>
