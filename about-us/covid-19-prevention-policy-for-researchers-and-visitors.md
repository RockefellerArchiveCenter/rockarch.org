permalink: /about-us/covid-19-prevention-policy-for-researchers-and-visitors/
---

The purpose of this policy is to reaffirm the Rockefeller Archive Center’s commitment to maintain a safe workplace, and to ensure that researchers and visitors are aware of their responsibilities in relation to COVID-19. This policy will outline the actions that will be required of researchers and visitors who want or need to be onsite at the RAC.

The RAC is monitoring guidance from all applicable public health authorities, and it reserves the right to modify this policy as necessary or appropriate. Any questions or concerns about the application of this policy can be directed to Human Resources.

## Policy

For purposes of this policy, a visitor is an individual who enters any RAC facility and is not an employee of the RAC or an on-site contractor. A researcher is an individual who is scheduled to be on-site and requires the use of the RAC Reading Rooms.

Prior to admission to the RAC, all researchers and visitors must:
- Read and comply with this policy;
- Report that they are fully vaccinated with vaccines that have met the necessary criteria for safety and efficacy as set by the World Health Organization (WHO);
- Certify that they have not been in close or proximate contact in the past 10 days with anyone who has tested positive for COVD-19 or who has symptoms of COVID-19;
- Certify that they have not tested positive for COVID-19 in the past 10 days; and
- Certify that they have not experienced any symptoms of COVID-19 in the past 10 days.

In addition, researchers who have traveled outside of the United States within five (5) days of their scheduled visit, must additionally provide a negative COVID-19 test approved by the CDC or the NYS Department of Health.

## Procedures for Researchers

Researchers will need to present (i.e., show, not hand over) their proof of vaccination, proof of identification, and, if necessary, a negative COVID-19 test result prior to entering the RAC. Researchers should coordinate well ahead of their scheduled visit with the employee designated to assist them. For researchers, this process will likely take place during the initial virtual interview.

Proof of vaccination may include:
- CDC vaccination card (or photo)
- The record of immunization from a healthcare provider or pharmacy;
- NYS Excelsior Pass;
- A copy of medical records documenting the vaccination; or
- An official immunization record from outside the United States.

Valid Identification includes your name accompanied by a photograph OR your date of birth, such as:
- Driver’s license
- Government ID card
- Passport
- School ID card

## Mask-Wearing Requirement

The RAC will require all researchers and visitors to wear masks while traveling throughout the buildings, when attending meetings of any kind, and while in the RAC Reading Rooms. Masks are required while gathering in common areas and should only be removed for eating or drinking. Researchers and visitors will be allowed to take mask breaks throughout the day in a designated area of the building.

Researchers and visitors may use their own acceptable face coverings, see CDC face covering guidance; however, the RAC will provide acceptable face coverings if necessary. These items will be stocked throughout the buildings.

## Occupancy Limits

Researchers and visitors are encouraged and expected to maintain distance between themselves and others in shared spaces and hallways.

Seating has been adjusted in common areas such as the dining room, conference rooms, researcher lounge, and blue room. The RAC will still ask researchers and visitors to maintain distance between themselves and others within these and other common areas; however, more than one person at a time will be allowed in these spaces.

## Requests for Accommodations

The RAC will consider requests for accommodations for disabilities and/or pregnancy on an individual basis in accordance with applicable legal requirements. The RAC will request additional information or documentation it deems necessary or appropriate to inform its decision on an accommodation request.
