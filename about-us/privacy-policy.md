## Protecting the privacy of our users
Rockefeller Archive Center (RAC) is committed to protecting your privacy while enabling your access to information and engagement in our research community. We strive to make our archival collections and services as widely accessible as possible. To do this we need to acquire and use some personal information. This policy explains what information we collect from you and why, and how it is collected, used, and stored. It applies to your engagement with us through our services and activities on websites and during your visits to our physical premises.

Guided by legal requirements governing people in the EU/EEA and UK, this Policy also provides a legal basis for our processing of your personal information. By data “processing,” we mean any operation performed on personal data including collection, organization, storage, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, dissemination, restriction, or erasure. The Rockefeller Archive Center is located in the United States, and your data will be transferred to and processed in the United States.

This Policy does not pertain to the acquisition or processing of personal information contained within our archival collections, for which we have a legitimate legal basis for archiving in the public interest.

## What information do we collect and why?
We capture the minimum amount of personal information that we need for a particular purpose, and we keep it only as long as is necessary to fulfill that purpose. Information will only be accessed by RAC staff with a legitimate business need to do so. We collect and process data that we obtain or that you provide to us in the following contexts:

All of our public sites use Google Analytics.

This data can include:

#### Google Analytics
All Rockefeller Archive Center websites use Google Analytics to gather anonymized, aggregated data about how people use our sites. Google Analytics uses a browser cookie that is placed on your device to gather data related to your activity. We anonymize IP addresses in our analytics implementation, so your IP address is not stored in Google servers. We do not use Google Advertising Features, so no demographic data is made available to us. However, if you log into a Google Account while using our websites, that can enable additional data tracking by Google. You can opt out by deleting and turning off cookies in the preferences settings of your browser, or by installing the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). You can [learn more about how Google uses your data](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites) from Google.

## Cookie notice
When you access websites and use services online, sometimes those sites place a small data file on your device called a cookie. Some cookies are essential for a webpage to function properly or they improve its functioning, and others provide reporting information.

We use first-party session cookies on some web pages to improve the experience of using our sites. These are deleted when the browser is closed, and do not store any information that will personally identify you. We also include links to external sites like social media sharing that will place cookies on your device. We use third-party cookies including statistical cookies from Google Analytics to gather information to improve our websites and enable certain functions. We do not use advertising cookies. Read more about [how Google uses cookies](https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies?hl=en) and access [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en).

You can [block, manage, and delete cookies](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0042-online-tracking) yourself at any time.

### What information do we share with third parties?
We do not sell your personal data to any other organizations. We will only share your personal data for the following purposes:

- As required by law or in a legal proceeding.
- As otherwise authorized by you.

## How can you contact us about your privacy?
You may contact us for additional information, to request access to or a copy of your personal data, or to request certain data be updated or removed. We will consider and respond to any requests in accordance with applicable laws. If you have consented to data processing, you can withdraw your consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of any processing that was done based on your previous consent. Please note that if your data is contained within our archival collections, rather than collected by the RAC for the reasons stated in this Policy, we will not alter the record.

## Changes to this policy
We will review this Policy periodically and may make changes in coordination with our [Records Management Policy](https://docs.rockarch.org/rm-policy/) and Records Retention Schedule.
