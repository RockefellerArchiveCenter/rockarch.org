## Introduction

The Rockefeller Archive Center is a repository of historical materials and a research center
dedicated to the study of philanthropy and the many domains touched by American foundations,
individual donors, and the civil society organizations they support. It was established in 1974
initially to gather, preserve, and make accessible the records of the Rockefeller family and their far-reaching
philanthropic endeavors, such as the Rockefeller University, Rockefeller Foundation, and
Rockefeller Brothers Fund. The Archive Center has grown and today holds the archives of major
foundations, cultural organizations, research institutions, and many individuals associated with
these organizations.

Over 400 researchers from around the world – graduate students, professors, independent
scholars, and journalists – visit annually. Their research topics range from the history of medicine,
science, and public health to such fields as the arts, agriculture, social sciences, urban a!airs, and
public policy. The RAC also seeks to connect and sustain its scholarly community through
workshops, conferences, and support for sessions at academic gatherings.
