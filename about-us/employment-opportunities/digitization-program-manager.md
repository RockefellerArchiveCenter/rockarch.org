## About the Rockefeller Archive Center
Located in Sleepy Hollow, NY, The Rockefeller Archive Center (RAC) was established in 1974 as the result of efforts by the children of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. to gather in one institution the records of their family’s philanthropic work and to stimulate research into the ways in which these philanthropic efforts had impacted the nation and the world. Since that time, the Archive Center has grown substantially, so that it now holds the archives of a large and growing number of philanthropic institutions, including the Ford Foundation, the Knight Foundation, the Hewlett Foundation, and many other foundations and civil society organizations, as well as the papers of individuals associated with these organizations.

In the RAC’s collections, researchers from all over the world can explore topics ranging from the history of medicine, science, and public health to such fields as the arts, agriculture, social sciences, urban affairs, and public policy. The RAC’s stipend program provides support for those who need to travel to the Archive Center for their research, while its rich online resources engage even larger global communities. In addition, the RAC regularly convenes conferences, workshops, and other gatherings to bring diverse communities together to discuss significant issues related to its collections.

The Rockefeller Archive Center is led by a President, Director of Human Resources and Operations, Director of Archives, and Director of Research & Engagement. The Access team is positioned within the Archives program, is led by the Assistant Director for Access, and includes four Archivists, two Archival Assistants, and three Reading Room Assistants. The mission of the Access team is to connect the RAC’s user communities to the collections, both onsite and virtually. The RAC’s user communities include researchers, records donor and depositor organizations, and RAC staff, teams, and program areas.
