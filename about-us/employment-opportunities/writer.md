## Position Summary
The Rockefeller Archive Center (RAC) seeks a strong researcher and storyteller who can produce compelling, relevant, accurate, and timely written content. The Writer is a key member of the Research & Engagement team, producing work drawing from our archival collections to engage with diverse stakeholder communities.

The RAC is the largest single assemblage of historical records of philanthropy in the world with the records of more than 40 foundations, including the Rockefeller, Ford, Henry Luce, William and Flora Hewlett, and John S. and James L. Knight foundations. It also holds the records of nonprofit organizations with strong connections to philanthropy, such as the Social Science Research Council, the National Committee for US-China Relations, and the Institute for International Education. 

The RAC attracts a global user base numbering in the thousands annually and provides broad and equitable public access to RAC collections. Researchers use our collections to explore topics ranging from the history of medicine and science to public health, agriculture, the arts, social sciences, international relations, and urban affairs, to name a few. Our Research & Engagement Program is a staff of historians, educators, designers, and archivists who work in a public history framework to engage constituencies in archival education, primary source research, and historical understanding. Our work is primarily public-facing, but we also work regularly with RAC’s record-depositing organizations, such as the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations.

The Writer will report to the Associate Director for Research & Engagement and will be expected to create content for online publications, conduct research and analysis to support the needs of senior staff and occasionally our depositing organizations, and will be expected to work with RAC colleagues as well as external contributors to produce a variety of published products. We seek a generalist who can quickly research, summarize, and contextualize the wide range of subjects contained in our holdings.

The ideal candidate will have experience writing for diverse audiences across multiple platforms and will be able to adjust tone and scope as each project demands. Experience in cultural heritage institutions or knowledge of philanthropic foundations and the nonprofit sector would be helpful.
