## Archives Program

The Archives Program of the Rockefeller Archive Center fosters and supports a
broad community of users examining the history of philanthropy and its related
endeavors. We acquire, preserve, make accessible, and encourage research and
scholarship in the papers and records in our care, while promoting effective
records and information management practices within foundations.  We engage in
and advance the archival profession by ensuring that our staff participates
broadly in professional activities and organizations. We lead by example in the
use and dissemination of open source information management tools, and we
advocate for open access to information in all its forms.   

The Archives Program achieves this mission through five interconnected function
areas that represent the lifecycle of records, from creation and use within an
organization to acquisition and public accessibility as archives at the Center:
the Records and Information Management Program, Collections Management,
Processing, Access, and Digital Strategies.

### Records and Information Management Program

The Records and Information Management Program uses the information governance
framework to promote effective information management as an essential practice
at the RAC, the institutions whose records we collect, and across the broader
foundation community. We champion effective stewardship of information assets
during the active part of their lifecycle to ensure they are stored, accessed,
and disposed of in a manner that supports current organizational needs as well
as institutional knowledge and learning. We empower records creators to develop
information management policies and practices based on an institution’s shared
definition of how systems are used and the recognition that content rather than
format determines record status. 

### Collections Management

Collections Management provides the critical physical control and the initial descriptive point of
access to our diverse and multi-format archival holdings while taking into account the needs of
the materials themselves. Through careful preservation and monitoring of our collections, we
strive to extend the lifecycle while sustaining the integrity of the collections. We serve as a
resource for preserving the Center’s audiovisual collections and for making these unique
resources accessible to our users. We also maintain and support the Center’s library of published
materials documenting the products and legacy of our donors as an important supplemental
resource for users of our archival holdings.

### Processing

The Processing team establishes and enhances intellectual and physical control of
our archival holdings by effectively and efficiently organizing, describing, and
preserving all eligible materials, regardless of form, medium, or creator, to
facilitate user access. We ensure timely, open, and equitable access to primary
sources on site and online. We actively promote the use and understanding of the
historical record through the collection guides we create in accordance with DACS
descriptive standards, and all program policies and procedures foster accountability
and transparency. The Processing team commits to culturally competent descriptive
practices, as we acknowledge that our collections and the archival descriptions we
create are shaped by racial, gendered, and other cultural identities and biases.
We aim to describe materials representing marginalized, underrepresented, and
historically oppressed people and cultures appropriately and respectfully. As we
learn and grow through professional development, we seek opportunities to
contribute to the archival profession and collaborate with practitioners in related
fields.

### Access

The Access Team promotes the accessibility and discoverability of archival collections to our
users. By responding to inquiries, educating researchers and donors on the scope and structure of
the collections, and providing physical access through our reading rooms, duplication services,
and digitization processes, we establish a genuine connection between our community of users
and our holdings.

### Digital Strategies

The Digital Strategies team leads the ethical application of technology in all aspects of the RAC's work by connecting people to systems and expertise. We develop, implement, and maintain the organization’s archival systems and digital infrastructure; build capacity through training designed to empower our colleagues; center user perspectives to continually improve the usability and accessibility of our systems and collections; and participate in professional communities to further our work and the archival profession.

## Research & Engagement Program

The Research and Engagement Program (R+E) at the RAC brings together historians, educators, and archivists to explore issues in the history of philanthropy for public, scholarly, and professional audiences and to cultivate new audiences for archival research. The team’s activities include digital publishing, conferences and workshops, al outreach, practitioner engagement, and a competitive research stipend program. R+E helps further the RAC mission of access by providing a narrative entry into RAC archival collections and fostering broad engagement with the history of philanthropy.

The division’s flagship website, [_RE:source_](https://resource.rockarch.org), examines the role philanthropy has played in the world we live in today. From the civil rights movement to the development of business schools, from dance and theater to overseas agricultural development, private money has affected myriad aspects of social, political, economic, and cultural life both in the U.S. and globally. The aim of RE:source is to bring stories from the history of philanthropy to the general public as well as a foundation practitioner audience.

Through other activities, R+E works regularly with foundation staff and leadership, providing historical perspectives on philanthropic practice and program evolution. The team often serves as a bridge between practice and scholarship by contributing new research to scholarly communities at professional conferences and by organizing workshops and convenings on emerging issues in the fields of history, archives, and philanthropy.
Each year, the R+E Program administers a competitive stipend program, which provides travel reimbursement funds to researchers from around the world. These awards enable some fifty researchers annually to travel to Sleepy Hollow to work in the RAC collections.

Through R+E’s [Archival  Program](https://resource.rockarch.org/archival-/), the team develops archive projects with local schools that serve as laboratories for curriculum development. We work with students ranging in level from middle and high school to undergraduate. The open al resources developed in these classrooms are hosted on OER Commons, and include documents, photographs, posters, advertisements, and film clips drawn from RAC holdings. The materials cover a range of topics such as voter , wartime scholar rescue efforts, immigration, and scientific innovation. In addition to topical interest, these curricula support the development of interdisciplinary research as well as digital and information literacy skills.
