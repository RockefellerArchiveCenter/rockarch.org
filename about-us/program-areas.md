## Archives Program

The Archives Program of the Rockefeller Archive Center fosters and supports a broad community
of users examining the history of philanthropy and its related endeavors. We acquire, preserve,
make accessible, and encourage research and scholarship in the papers and records of the
Rockefeller family and Rockefeller-founded institutions, and those of other foundations,
nonprofit organizations, and related individuals undertaking philanthropic work and scientific
and medical research. We engage in and advance the archival profession by ensuring that our staff
participates broadly in professional activities and organizations. We lead by example in the use
and dissemination of open source information management tools, and we advocate for open
access to information in all its forms.

The Archives Program achieves this mission through four interconnected function areas that
manage the Center’s archival holdings from acquisition to accessibility: Collections Management,
Processing, Reference, and Digital Program.

### Collections Management

Collections Management provides the critical physical control and the initial descriptive point of
access to our diverse and multi-format archival holdings while taking into account the needs of
the materials themselves. Through careful preservation and monitoring of our collections, we
strive to extend the lifecycle while sustaining the integrity of the collections. We serve as a
resource for preserving the Center’s audiovisual collections and for making these unique
resources accessible to our users. We also maintain and support the Center’s library of published
materials documenting the products and legacy of our donors as an important supplemental
resource for users of our archival holdings.

### Processing

The Processing team establishes and enhances intellectual and physical control of our archival
holdings by efficiently and effectively organizing, describing, and preserving all eligible materials,
regardless of form, medium or creator, in order to facilitate user access onsite and online. In
working to reduce and ultimately eliminate the Center’s processing backlog, we ensure timely
open and equitable access to primary sources. We actively promote the use and understanding of
the historical record through the collection guides we create in accordance with DACS descriptive
standards, and all program policies, practices, and procedures foster accountability and
transparency. As we learn and grow through professional development, we seek opportunities to
contribute to the archival profession and collaborate with participants in related fields.

### Reference

The Reference Team promotes the accessibility and discoverability of archival collections to our
users. By responding to inquiries, educating researchers and donors on the scope and structure of
the collections, and providing physical access through our reading rooms, duplication services,
and digitization processes, we establish a genuine connection between our community of users
and our holdings.

### Digital Programs

The Digital Programs team facilitates broad and equitable access to and responsible preservation of
materials in our custody by providing technical leadership and expertise to staff in all program
areas. We further our work and the archival profession by taking a collaborative, transparent, and
standards-based approach, contributing to open-source systems and communities. We engage
researchers, staff, and donors to understand their needs, prioritize solutions, and produce high-quality
and useful tools and services.

## Research & Education Program

The Research and Education Department oversees many of the external programs of the
Rockefeller Archive Center. It administers a competitive research stipend program that awards 40
to 50 research stipends each year to graduate students, faculty members, and independent
scholars. It organizes and hosts several workshops and conferences each year. And staff members
on the research and education team edit and publish a series of research reports describing
scholarly work at the RAC, a publishing program that is now primarily electronic and web-based.

The 2009 renovation of the Archive Center's Carriage House provides space for the research and
education staff as well as three to six visiting scholars. The scholar-in-residence program serves
researchers who have done research at the Archive Center and learned that they need to spend an
extended period of time, ranging from several months to a full academic year, on their archival
research. The staff has also expanded an annual teaching fellows program for area middle and
high school teachers interested in using primary source materials in their classrooms.

The educational programs engage a number of area colleges and universities. The RAC brings
university faculty and their graduate or undergraduate students to the Archive Center for course-related
lectures and seminars, advises students on papers and theses, and helps faculty to find
primary materials for their teaching. The staff offers lectures, seminars, and workshops for the
Archive Center's college summer intern program. They also participate in meetings of various
professional associations, delivering papers and organizing panels for RAC researchers.

There are several public outreach initiatives of the research and education program. The RAC
regularly invites members of local historical societies to tour the archives. It organizes exhibits
and presentations about archival holdings for board and staff members of donor organizations.
The research and education staff also works with other Pocantico-based organizations on public
programs, showing films and organizing exhibitions and lectures for the local community.
